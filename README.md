# 16-QAM-tx-rx-system
This MATLAB project simulates a 16-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) digital communication system, including both transmitter and receiver components. It provides a step-by-step demonstration of signal generation, modulation, transmission over a noisy channel, demodulation, and bit error rate (BER) analysis.
